Working with ICU datasets, especially with publicly available ones as provided by [Physionet](https://physionet.org) in R is facilitated by `ricu`, which provides data access, a level of abstraction to encode clinical concepts in a data source agnostic way, as well as classes and utilities for working with the arising types of time series datasets.

## Installation

You can install the released version of ricu from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("ricu")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub!
