\item{sofa_score}{\code{ts_tbl} with a column \code{sofa_score}}

\item{susp_inf}{\code{ts_tbl} with columns \code{si_lwr} and \code{si_upr} defining windows for
which a suspected infection is valid}

window}

\item{sofa_thresh}{Required SOFA increase to trigger Sepsis 3}

\item{si_lwr, si_upr}{Lower/upper extent of SI windows}

\item{interval}{Time series interval (only used for checking consistency
of input data)}

\item{x}{Vector of SOFA scores}

\item{shifts}{Vector of time shifts (multiples of the current interval) over
which \code{\link[base:pmin]{base::pmin()}} is evaluated}

\description{
The sepsis 3 label consists of a suspected infection combined with an acute
increase in SOFA score.

\details{
The Sepsis-3 Consensus (\href{https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2492881}{Singer et. al. 2016.}) defined sepsis as an acute increase in the SOFA score (see \code{\link[=sofa_score]{sofa_score()}}) of > 2 points within the suspected infection (SI) window (see \code{\link[=si_calc]{si_calc()}}):

A patient can potentially have multiple SI windows. The argument \code{si_window} is used to control which SI window we focus on (options are \verb{"first", "last", "any"}).

Further, although a 2 or more point increase in the SOFA score is defined, it is not perfectly clear to which value the increase refers. For this the \code{delta_fun} argument is used. If the increase is required to happen with respect to the minimal SOFA value (within the SI window) up to the current time, the \code{delta_cummin} function should be used. If, however, we are looking for an increase with respect to the start of the SI window, then the \code{delta_start} function should be used. Lastly, the increase might be defined with respect to values of the previous 24 hours, in which case the \code{delta_min} function is used.
