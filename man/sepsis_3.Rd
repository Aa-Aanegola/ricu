\item{sofa}{\code{ts_tbl} with a column \code{sofa_score}}

\item{si}{\code{ts_tbl} with columns \code{si_lwr} and \code{si_upr} defining windows for
which a suspected infection is valid}

\item{delta_fun}{Function used to determine the SOFA increase during an SI
window}

\item{sofa_thresh}{Required SOFA increase to trigger Sepsis 3}

\item{x}{Vector of SOFA scores}

\item{shifts}{Vector of time shifts (multiples of the current interval) over
which \code{\link[base:pmin]{base::pmin()}} is evaluated}
}
\description{
The sepsis 3 label consists of a suspected infection combined with an acute
increase in SOFA score.
}
\details{
The Sepsis-3 Consensus (Singer et. al. 2016.) defined sepsis as an acute increase in the SOFA score (see \code{\link{sofa}}) of > 2 points within the suspected infection (SI) window (see \code{\link{si_windows}}):

\figure{sep-3.png}

A patient can potentially have multiple SI windows. The argument \code{si_window} is used to control which SI window we focus on (options are \code{"first", "last", "any"}).

Further, although a 2 or more point increase in the SOFA score is defined, it is not perfectly clear to which value the increase refers. For this the \code{delta_fun} argument is used. If the increase is required to happen with respect to the minimal SOFA value up to the current time, the \code{delta_cummin} function should be used. If, however, we are looking for an increase with respect to the start of the SI window, then the \code{delta_start} function should be used.
