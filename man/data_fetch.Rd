\usage{
download_mimic(
  demo = FALSE,
  dest = mimic_data_dir(demo),
  config = mimic_config(demo),
  table_sel = NULL,
  ...
)

download_eicu(
  demo = FALSE,

}
\arguments{
\item{demo}{Logical switch between demo (TRUE) and full (FALSE) datasets.}

\item{dest}{Destination directory where the downloaded data is written to.}

\item{config}{List structure with configuration information (see
\code{\link[=import_mimic]{import_mimic()}} for further information).}

\item{table_sel}{Character vector specifying the tables to download. If
\code{NULL}, all available tables are downloaded.}

\item{...}{Passed onto keyring, for example \code{\link[keyring:key_set_with_value]{keyring::key_set_with_value()}}.}

\description{
The \href{https://lcp.mit.edu/index.html}{Laboratory for Computational Physiology } (LCP) at MIT hosts two large-scale
databases of hospital intensive care units (ICUs), both of which can be
either downloaded in full or as demo subsets. While both databases are
publicly available, full download requires credentialed access which can be
gained by applying for up an account with \href{https://physionet.org}{PhysioNet }.
}
\details{
The Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC) database holds
detailed clinical data from roughly 60,000 patient stays in Beth Israel
Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC) intensive care units between 2001 and 2012.
The database includes information such as demographics, vital sign
measurements made at the bedside (~1 data point per hour), laboratory test
results, procedures, medications, caregiver notes, imaging reports, and
mortality (both in and out of hospital). For further information, please
refer to the \href{https://mimic.physionet.org/about/mimic}{MIMIC-III documentation }.

More recently, Philips Healthcare and LCP began assembling the eICU
Collaborative Research Database as a multi-center resource for ICU data.
Combining data of several critical care units throughout the continental
United States from the years 2014 and 2015, this database contains
deidentified health data associated with over 200,000 admissions, including
vital sign measurements, care plan documentation, severity of illness
measures, diagnosis information, and treatment information. For further
information, please refer to the \href{https://eicu-crd.mit.edu/about/eicu}{eICU documentation }.

In case the keyring package is available, credentials used to log onto
PhysioNet are stored using \code{\link[keyring:key_set]{keyring::key_set()}}, therefore allowing for non-
interactive querying of the PhysioNet service. Furthermore, if the openssl
package is available, SHA256 hashes of downloaded files are verified using
\code{\link[openssl:sha256]{openssl::sha256()}}.
